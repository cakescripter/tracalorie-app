- **Local Storage Integration:** _(v2)_ The application now incorporates local storage functionality, ensuring that your tracked data persists even after closing the browser or refreshing the page. This enhancement provides a more seamless experience and prevents data loss.

- **Webpack Integration:** _(v3)_ Webpack was integrated into the project to optimize its performance and loading times.
