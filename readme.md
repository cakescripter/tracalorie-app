- **Local Storage Integration:** _(v2)_ The application now incorporates local storage functionality, ensuring that your tracked data persists even after closing the browser or refreshing the page. This enhancement provides a more seamless experience and prevents data loss.

- **Webpack Integration:** _(v3)_ Webpack was integrated into the project to optimize its performance and loading times. By bundling and minifying JavaScript, CSS, and other assets, the overall file sizes were reduced, leading to faster loading times for users. Additionally, Webpack allowed the utilization of the latest ECMAScript modules (ES modules) syntax, enabling better code organization and modularity.
